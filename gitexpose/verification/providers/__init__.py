"""VERIFIERS registry — single source of truth for provider verifier callables.

Each entry: pattern_name (str) → Callable[[str], Awaitable[VerificationResult]]

Lookup is by `pattern_name` matching the `type` field of secret-dicts (which is
the same as the JSON pattern name in `gitexpose/data/credential_patterns_v02.json`).
